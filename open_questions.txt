There are still a few open questions:

1. Consider this test:

    def test_writingALowerCaseCharacterAfterFailingToWriteAnUpperCaseCharacter(self):
        p = Pencil(length = 40, pointDurability = 1, eraserDurability = 200)
        p.write("By")
        expectedText = # should this be "  " or " y"?
        self.assertTrue(p.getText() == expectedText)
        
   As the code is written now, the result of p.getText() will be "  ".

2. Does the '@' for attempts to overwrite non-whitespace characters count as writing,
   i.e. can/should it take place even if the point durability is zero? As the code is
   written now, it does count.
   
3. Should it be possible to erase more than one string and then select one of them
   to overwrite? As the code stands now, it remembers the last-erased text and
   forgets it after it's overwritten.
